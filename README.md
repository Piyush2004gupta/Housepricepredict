 House Price Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression 🏡📊
Today, I implemented a simple yet powerful machine learning approach — Multiple Linear Regression — to predict house prices based on features like area and number of bedrooms.
🔢 Why Multiple Linear Regression?
 It helps capture the relationship between multiple factors influencing price and provides a predictive equation to estimate house value.
✅ Covered in today's project:
 ✔ Preparing the dataset
 ✔ Building and training the linear model
 ✔ Evaluating performance with MAE, MSE, and R² Score
 ✔ Predicting price for new house data
